comfy_imprint
=============

Distributed as a gem, relies on SimpleForm, while this is an engine, it's inteded for use with Comfortable Mexican Sofa,     and it may work with other Rails apps, but is not tested for them. Why not comfy_contact - cause keeping track of ComfyContact::Contact.contact - hurts my head.
